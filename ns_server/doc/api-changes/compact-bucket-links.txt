In our tradition of advertising hyperlinks to various information &
services we need to publish links to POST requests that forcefully
trigger bucket compaction.

It's now done as part of controllers field of bucket info. E.g.:

       "controllers": {
            "flush": "/pools/default/buckets/default/controller/doFlush",
            "compactAll": "/pools/default/buckets/default/controller/compactBucket",
            "compactDB": "/pools/default/buckets/default/controller/compactDatabases"
        },
